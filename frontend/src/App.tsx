          There are so many positive effects you have on our family. You plan
          activities for our kids, even though they are{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>CRAZY</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          every single time. You make time to get presents for our kids' bus
          drivers and teachers, you invite over their friends, even if its
          difficult.
        </p>
        <p>You are selfless.</p>
        <p>
          Without you, this family would be lost, so I wanted to tell you that
          you are the most important person on the planet to Noah, Kenzie, Nyah,
          Benny, and I. Happy 31st Birthday, and I hope this coming year, is our
          year to shine.

          I love you. You are the best mommy ever. I love playing with you. I
          love to color with you.

          I like to play with Nyah with you. My favorite activity is going on a
          walk with you.

          I will always appreciate how much you make me laugh and smile and I'm
          so proud that I have a sister that I can look up to who works so hard
          every day. On top of all that, you've brought some of the most
          important people in my life into the world and I can't wait to see how
          all of our lives grow together, for this year and those to come.
          <p>I love you, and again, happy birthday!</p>
