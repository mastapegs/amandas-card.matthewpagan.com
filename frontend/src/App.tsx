          There are so many positive effects you have on our family. You plan
          activities for our kids, even though they are{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>CRAZY</em>
          </strong>{" "}
          every single time. You make time to get presents for our kids' bus
          drivers and teachers, you invite over their friends, even if its
          difficult.
        </p>
        <p>You are selfless.</p>
        <p>
          Without you, this family would be lost, so I wanted to tell you that
          you are the most important person on the planet to Noah, Kenzie, Nyah,
          Benny, and I. Happy 31st Birthday, and I hope this coming year, is our
          year to shine.
